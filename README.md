# Recreational-Drug-Advertisements-Effects-on-Gen-Z-Millenials
Age interval used, 17-30. Data is subject to change, sample size is small as of 4/8/22.

TOPIC  - Media & Advertising’s Effect on Drug Usage (Alcohol, Cigarettes and now Cannabis as it starts to be legalized) 

PLAN
Null Hypothesis: we assume that there is no evidence to support the idea that recreational drug advertising has a negative effect on drug consumption & purchasing behaviors of Gen-Z & Millennials. [17-30]

Alternate Hypothesis: there is evidence to support the fact that recreational drug advertisements have a negative effect on drug consumption & purchasing behaviors of Gen-Z & Millennials. 

I will be performing a statistical analysis of the effect of recreational drug advertising on youthful minds. In particular my project will consist of an age interval of 17-30 and will look to highlight the effects of recreational drug advertising on purchasing and consumption habits; I am mainly looking to understand whether brand recognition, loyalty or presence has a direct or indirect effect on younger minds. I would also like to incorporate some outlier based data with individuals spanning outside my main interval of data. 

There will be 3 parts to my data gathering. Firstly, I will be asking participants for their age and sex, which will consist of male (M), female (F) and other/doesn’t feel comfortable responding (O). Secondly, I will ask them 4 questions highlighted below in the METRICS section, and determine a yes (Y) or no (N) answer, with a 4th question that is optional but could give me valuable insight towards purchasing/consumption behaviors. My initial plan was to highlight a few of the questions and based their answer on a variety of metrics given a long more thoughtful answer; in particular question 3. What I noticed is that the data I am looking for should be more quantitative and qualitative as I am looking to decipher and analyze the data from which I can infer a more precise and accurate assessment of advertising’s effect on purchasing & consumption, instead of qualitative answers where natural language processing is involved. Furthermore, as I will reiterate below, this project could expand far beyond my simple parameters so questions and responses are subject to vary based on continuous efforts. Regardless, the project will continue under my specific parameters as a pilot study of some sort in order to assess advertising and its potential effect on the youth’s recreational drug purchasing & consumption behaviors. 

EXPECTATIONS AND NEED FOR RESEARCH
I really want to assess and understand a subtle psychological effect of the youth which is their recreational drug purchasing/consumption behaviors, especially of those within a wide variety of income levels, which is why my sample size will be thoroughly randomized and will not be polarized towards one specific region but rather from a variety of cities. The data and analysis found from this research will hopefully aid in my understanding of recreational drug usage within the younger generation. Furthermore, understanding the consumption/purchasing behaviors can help provide inferences into whether drug advertisements can be considered harmful or uneffective towards youthful minds. 

FURTHER EXPANSION
There are many courses of action that could expand this research project such as involvement with exact income classes and the effect of social class on advertisement effectiveness; i.e. does watching recreational advertisements have different psychological effects within different social classes. OR, using one specific recreational industry and determining the same inferences and analysis I am using in this project within that specific industry (e.g Beer, tobacco, cannabis). Furthermore, expansions of this work can provide valuable insight for advertising agencies, drug prevention & youth regulations if need-be. The source code will be posted to my github to be altered in the event more data is provided and a potential expansion to this project is allowed. The data on the other hand will not be posted for this specific “pilot” hypothesis as the data at this point and time is quite personal and might be deemed as unfavorable to the public-eye. Questions at this point and time are more personal than what is typically understood within a psychological project (and this is not funded so questions can stretch as far as my own curiosity’s sake); regardless, the data will not be posted unless approved. To the extent of a potential, full-fledged research project, the source code and data will absolutely be posted to achieve full transparency and accurate analysis. 

METRICS 
Standard age population will be roughly from 17-30
Randomized sample 
Do online advertisements promoting recreational drugs (typically by bigger tobacco, alcohol, & now cannabis companies) have a direct effect on the purchasing and consumption behavior of younger generations? (Again sample size is 17-30) 
SPECIFIC QUESTIONS: 
Are you more enticed to go out and purchase/consume recreational drugs given your age? (if under 21, leave it be; if not ask why or why not)
Do recreational drugs need to be advertised heavily? 
Do recreational drug advertisements make you more self-conscious about your recreational consumption/purchasing? (Whether your a consumer or not) 
OPTIONAL: Given 4 different income intervals, please respond to your respective interval. If uncomfortable, answer with 0. (1)$0-74,999; (2) $75,000-$124,999; (3) $125,000-$200,000 (4) $200,000+
